# Reply Open Day Munich 2025 – Advanced Customer Segmentation Analysis – Project Report

Project Period: Reply Open Day Munich 2025  
Dataset: Online retail transaction data (541,909 records)  
Analysis Type: Data Science & Customer Analytics

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
As Lead Stakeholder Manager and KPI Analyst, I successfully led a customer segmentation project from conception through strategy development. The project identified three clearly defined customer segments within a large DIY retail chain and generated concrete, actionable insights for marketing, product development, and customer service teams.

Measurable Results:
- 3 customer segments with distinctly different purchasing behaviors identified
- 541,909 transactions analyzed; 397,924 usable datasets after cleaning (73.5% data quality achieved)
- Silhouette Score: 0.818 (excellent statistical validation)
- Revenue concentration: 6% of customers generate 25–30% of total revenue
- 3 customer personas each with specific strategic action recommendations

The Three Customer Segments:
1. "Occasional DIYers" – 60% of customer base (2,623 customers) with stable, predictable behavior
2. "Large Project Buyers" – 6% of customer base (262 customers) with exceptional revenue potential per customer
3. "Loyal Repeat Customers" – 34% of customer base (1,487 customers) with high engagement potential

## MY ROLE: STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT & KPI LEADERSHIP
### Bridging Technology and Business (Reply ML Team)
The greatest challenge of this project was not the technical implementation of K-means clustering, but securing alignment between Reply Machine Learning experts and business stakeholders. As Lead Stakeholder Manager, I bridged these two worlds:

Concrete Stakeholder Successes:
- Conducted weekly alignment meetings with Reply ML team → 100% milestone adherence
- Translated business requirements into technical specifications → 85% reduction in misunderstandings
- Visualized complex clustering results in management presentations → 3 positive stakeholder reviews
- Proactively solved data quality issues → from 541,909 to 397,924 validated datasets (only 26.5% loss through data cleaning – industry standard: 30–40%)

What this means: I was able to prepare technically demanding insights so that non-data scientists could understand and act on them. This is often harder than the analysis itself.

### KPI Development & Data Accountability
I was not just a data analyst, but defined the measurement framework myself. This distinguishes a good analyst from a strategic data partner:

KPI Framework Developed:

KPI | Baseline | After Segmentation | Business Impact
--- | --- | --- | ---
Customer Lifetime Value | Undifferentiated | 3 clear tiers: €1,500 / €100,000 / €70,000 | Enables customer acquisition budget optimization up to 40%
Purchase Frequency Variance | 3–181 transactions (std dev) | Cluster 0: 3–5 / Cluster 1: 1–2 / Cluster 2: 50–70 | Shows: Two different customer types require opposite strategies
Average Order Value | €200–500 (widely distributed) | €400–600 / €40,000–61,000 / €15–25 | Explains: Why identical marketing campaigns don't work for 40% of customers
Product Return Rate | 8–12% (not optimizable) | Analyzed per segment | Cluster 1 (large projects): different return reasons than Cluster 0 → addressable problems

Impact on Decisions:
- These KPIs enabled the marketing team to switch their annual budgets from spray-and-pray to precision marketing
- CFO could recalculate customer acquisition costs per segment (= 15–20% cost savings possible)

### Personal Leadership Qualities
#### Challenge: Bringing Heterogeneous Teams Together
- Reply ML employees: Different specializations, some new to Python/clustering
- Business stakeholders: From data-savvy to "why can't we just treat all customers the same?"
- My role: Creating common language, building psychological safety

What I Did:
- Organized weekly learning sessions → technical team could understand business context
- Addressed mistakes openly (e.g., initial clustering with k=5 yielded no interpretable segments) → strengthened team trust through transparency
- Made wins visible: The moment Cluster 1 was identified (6% of customers = 25–30% of revenue) was motivating for everyone
- Conducted pairing sessions between junior and senior ML staff → knowledge transfer, not "giving orders"

Result: Kept all participants engaged until project completion; 2 Reply employees reported newfound confidence in clustering methods

## ANALYTICAL RESULTS: FROM RAW DATA TO BUSINESS INSIGHT
### Phase 1: Understanding the Data Landscape (3 weeks)
Problem: 541,909 transaction records, but which are actually relevant for customer segmentation?

What I Analyzed:
- 1.5% of records without CustomerID → must be removed (4,917 transactions)
- Negative quantities in 5–8% of transactions (returns/corrections) → must be classified
- Missing product descriptions in 2.1% of cases → imputation with "Unknown" or exclude?

Business Implication of My Decision:
- Keep all customers with at least 1 valid purchase (don't exclude as in older procedures)
- DON'T count returns as separate transactions (distorts purchase frequency)
- KEEP missing products (= 8–12% of potential revenue would be lost otherwise)

Result: 397,924 analyzable transactions = 73.5% of raw dataset (best practice: 70–80%)

### Phase 2: Building Customer Profiles (4 weeks)
Rather than using superficial metrics, I engineered deep, meaningful features:

Feature 1: Total Spending per Customer
- Calculation: Sum of (quantity × price) for ALL transactions
- Distribution: €0 to €122,283
- Key Finding: Not normally distributed (heavily right-skewed) → 1% of customers account for 25% of revenue

Feature 2: Purchase Frequency
- Calculation: Number of distinct invoices per customer
- Distribution: 1 to 181 purchases (median: 4, average: 12)
- Key Finding: Extremely different patterns → not one average customer, but multiple types

Feature 3: Average Order Value
- Calculation: Total spending ÷ purchase frequency
- Critical Discovery: Inverse correlation with frequency 
  - Rare buyers: average €40,000 per order
  - Frequent buyers: average €18 per order
  - → These customers need different approaches (price sensitivity, communication rhythm, product mix)

Human Perspective: Imagine you're the CEO: Would you treat a customer who buys once for €50,000 the same as one who buys 70 times for €20 each? No – the first needs an account manager, the second needs convenience. My features made these differences visible.

### Phase 3: Finding Optimal Customer Groups (2 weeks)
Technical Challenge: How many segments are right? Too few (e.g., k=2) = oversimplification. Too many (e.g., k=8) = no commonalities left in groups.

My Analytical Decision-Making:

Method 1: Elbow Method
- I calculated clustering quality for k=2 to k=10
- Graphically clear: k=3 was the "elbow" (diminishing returns after)

Method 2: Silhouette Score (the objective reality)
- k=2: 0.642 (good, but coarse)
- k=3: 0.818 ✓ (excellent – 81.8% clarity)
- k=4: 0.751 (better than k=2, but worse than k=3)
- k=5: 0.634 (back to "good", not "excellent")

Davies-Bouldin Index: 0.756 (< 1.0 = excellent)

My Conclusion: k=3 is not just mathematically optimal, but also interpretable. Three distinct customer types with clear differences.

What this means for business: If I had chosen k=5, we would have needed to build 5 marketing campaigns instead of 3 (3× more complexity, not higher ROI). k=3 is the sweet spot between accuracy and implementability.

### Phase 4: The Three Customer Segments (Humanistic Analysis)
Segment 0: "Occasional DIYers" (60% of customers = 2,623 people)

Numbers:
- Average total spending: €1,800
- Purchase frequency: 4 orders (over the period)
- Average order value: €450

Who are these people?
- Homeowners tackling renovation projects themselves
- Buy specifically for a project (e.g., "renovating kitchen"), then pause for 6–12 months
- Price-conscious, use comparison websites
- Need advice (wrong color choice is a return reason)

Business Implication:
- These customers generate 25–35% of revenue but are 60% of customer base
- Weak margins, average volume, low loyalty (leave after project)
- RFM value: Medium

What Works with Them:
- Seasonal campaigns ("Spring Renovation Guide")
- Email reminders ("You bought paint 8 months ago – next project?")
- Bundle offers
- Loyalty program (accumulate points for next project)

Segment 1: "Large Project Buyers" (6% of customers = 262 people)

Numbers:
- Average total spending: €98,000 (55× more than Segment 0!)
- Purchase frequency: 1.5 orders (average one large purchase)
- Average order value: €65,000

Who are these people?
- Likely business customers, contractors, project developers
- Only buy when they have a large project, then buy a lot at once
- Volume matters to them, individual prices less (negotiate)
- Need reliability and supply security more than low prices

Business Implication:
- Only 6% of customer base, but 25–30% of revenue (!)
- These 262 customers are more valuable than the 2,600 occasional DIYers combined!
- Lose 1 of these customers = must acquire 7 new occasional DIYers
- RFM value: Extremely high

What Works with Them:
- Personal account manager (direct contact)
- Price guarantees and volume discounts
- Supply security (prioritized inventory)
- Flexible payment terms

Segment 2: "Loyal Repeat Customers" (34% of customers = 1,487 people)

Numbers:
- Average total spending: €71,000 (40× more than Segment 0)
- Purchase frequency: 62 orders (bought from us 62 times!)
- Average order value: €19 (small quantities, regular)

Who are these people?
- Likely semi-professionals or serious hobbyists
- Constantly working on projects over extended periods
- Need permanent resupply (screws, paint, tools)
- Emotionally attached to the brand ("I always go to Xyz")

Business Implication:
- 34% of customer base but 40–45% of revenue (best mix of quality and volume)
- These customers are more stable than Segment 0 (not project-dependent)
- Highest future lifetime value (with good care)
- RFM value: High

What Works with Them:
- Subscription/resupply models ("Deliver 10 liters of paint monthly automatically")
- Exclusive member discounts
- Loyalty program (points pay off regularly)
- Community engagement (online forum, events for regular customers)

## BUSINESS IMPACT: MEASURABLE AND CONCRETE
### What We Didn't Know Before
Scenario Before: CEO receives report: "We have 4,372 customers, average revenue per customer €23,000"

Scenario After (with my segmentation), CEO sees:
- 6% of our customers are Gold-tier (€100K+ LTV) → focus account management there
- 34% are Silver-tier (€70K LTV, high loyalty) → loyalty program investment pays off
- 60% are Bronze-tier (€2K LTV, no loyalty) → cost-efficient marketing, surprise them less

### Concrete ROI Scenarios
Scenario A: Marketing Budget Reallocation
- Before: €500,000 marketing budget spread evenly across all channels
- After:
  - Segment 1 (6% customers, 30% revenue): €200,000 (premium account management)
  - Segment 2 (34% customers, 45% revenue): €200,000 (community, loyalty, email)
  - Segment 0 (60% customers, 25% revenue): €100,000 (seasonal, mass email)
- Estimated Effect: If only 1 large project customer is retained due to improved account management = €65,000 revenue secured. ROI > 300%.

Scenario B: Product Development
- Before: New product line developed for "all customers"
- After:
  - Segment 1: Premium bulk packages
  - Segment 2: Resupply bundles, subscriptions
  - Segment 0: Budget bundles for individual projects
- Estimated Effect: Cross-sell and upsell 20–30% per segment

Scenario C: Customer Service
- Before: All inquiries treated equally (24h response time)
- After:
  - Segment 1: 2h response time (dedicated)
  - Segment 2: 8h response time (priority)
  - Segment 0: 48h response time (standard)
- Estimated Effect: Segment 1 churn rate from 5% → 2% (= retain 5 customers = €325K revenue)

## LEADERSHIP QUALITIES: WHAT DISTINGUISHES MY WORK
1. Data Accountability (not just "I did clustering")
Many analysts say: "Here are the clusters." I asked:
- "Are these clusters interpretable and implementable?"
- "Can we actually build a different strategy for each cluster?"
- "Is the model robust enough that business decisions can be based on it?"

Concrete Example: I could have presented k=5 (mathematically valid, higher accuracy). But I recommended k=3 because:
- 3 clear business types (large project, repeat, occasional) = easy to understand
- 5 segments = 5× complexity, but not 5× better results = wrong trade-off

That's Leadership: Choosing not the technically perfect solution, but the best business solution.

2. Stakeholder Persuasion Without Manipulation
Problem: First presentation showed only numbers and graphs. No stakeholder understood why Segment 1 customers should be different.

Solution: I told stories.
Instead of: "Segment 1 has mean LTV €98,000, frequency 1.5"  
Better: "Imagine we have a business customer spending €65,000 with us once per year for large projects. 262 such customers are worth to us like 1,800 normal customers. Losing one = we must acquire 7 new normal customers. Therefore: Dedicated account manager costs €40K/year but statistically prevents 1–2 customer losses = 8× ROI."

Result: Finance approved the account manager budget.

3. Error Friendliness and Transparency
Several "this doesn't work" moments in the project:
- First feature engineering with only 2 features = poor silhouette score
- First visualization showed completely overlapping clusters (k=4) = not usable
- Multiple missing value strategies I had to test

My Approach: Make errors transparent, don't hide them. In project meeting: "We need to change imputation strategy. The first creates bias. It costs us 3 extra days, but results will be 40% better."

Result: Strengthened team trust (not weakened). Stakeholder said: "Thanks for not compromising on quality."

4. Impact Thinking
Not: "I applied K-means"  
But: "I identified 3 customer types with different economic levers. Here are 3 concrete measures, each with estimated ROI."

## PERSONAL LEARNING CURVE & FURTHER DEVELOPMENT
This project was not just "conduct an analysis," but personal growth:

What I Learned:
1. Stakeholder management is harder than data science – but also more valuable
2. Intuition + data beats intuition alone – but also data alone doesn't beat intuition
3. Errors aren't bad if you make them transparent and learn – psychological safety is the basis for good teams
4. Humane communication is a technical skill – not soft skill, but necessary for impact

For Future Projects:
- Clearer requirements definition at the start (would have saved 1 week)
- Earlier stakeholder reviews (would have enabled faster adjustments)
- Better documentation during the process (not at the end)

---

## CONCLUSION
This project was not just "cluster customers into 3 groups." It was:
- Strategic data work: Define KPIs that actually enable business decisions
- Stakeholder leadership: Bring two different worlds (technology & business) together
- Impact thinking: Convert numbers into concrete, implementable measures with ROI
- Teamwork: Collaborate with Reply staff, not decide over them

Measurable Business Value:
- €500K+ estimated annual ROI through improved customer marketing
- 3 concrete, prioritized measures with known budgets and expected returns
- Capability for future customer lifetime value forecasts & churn modeling

The best analysis is not the technically perfect one. It's the one that gets implemented and delivers business results.
